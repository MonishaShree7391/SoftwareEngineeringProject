A modern, microservices-based web application for splitting grocery bills with roommates, friends, or groupsâ€”designed for real-world use with invoices from REWE, Kaufland, and more.

---

##  ðŸ§©Overview

**Sirantha RechnungSplit** simplifies shared grocery expense tracking by enabling users to upload PDF invoices, extract itemized data via OCR, and split costs between registered and non-registered users. It supports debt tracking, full/partial settlements, and admin-level user controlâ€”all backed by a scalable microservices architecture deployed on **Microsoft Azure**.

**Access to LIVE application:**
https://frontend-ui.victoriousriver-e1350c51.westus2.azurecontainerapps.io/login
if admin: https://frontend-ui.victoriousriver-e1350c51.westus2.azurecontainerapps.io/admin_dashboard.html

---

## ðŸ§© Microservices Architecture

The system is decomposed into the following services:

- **AuthService** â€“ Handles user registration, login, JWT auth, and profile/password management
- **InvoiceService** â€“ Processes uploaded PDF invoices via EasyOCR and regex parsing
- **SplitService** â€“ Manages bill splitting and cost distribution among participants
- **DebtService** â€“ Tracks real-time balances and records settlements
- **AdminService** â€“ Enables privileged actions (user role control, system-level views)
- **Frontend_UI** â€“ Flask-based web UI for user interaction

Each service is containerized using Docker and deployed via **Azure Container Apps**, communicating securely through REST APIs.
